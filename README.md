# MY Portfolio!
(see it live at https://tobygu.com)
Hey-yo! Welcome. All my stuff is built super responsive. Feel free to mess with your screen size ;)

- Enjoy!
- Toby.


### To get started

`yarn start`

### To bundle and build

`yarn build`

### How it works

This is technically a "project page" and hosted on github pages. This means all the html and assets are served from `./docs`. Technically this shouldn't be a thing, but I made it a thing lol.

### How to run the project
#### (and draw a mustache on my face)

To get started, just
```
git clone git@github.com:Saibotx/portfolio.git
```

then run
```
yarn install
yarn start

```

### How to deploy

```
yarn build
git commit ... git push etc.
```

Then you must go into githubv project settings and change the custom dns!
