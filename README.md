# MY Portfolio!
(see it live at https://tobygu.com)

Hey-yo! Welcome. All my stuff is built super responsive. Feel free to mess with your screen size ;)

- Enjoy!
- Toby.


### To get started

`yarn start`

### To bundle and build

`yarn build`

### How it works

This is technically a "project page" and hosted on github pages. This means all the html and assets are served from `./docs`. Technically this shouldn't be a thing, but I made it a thing.

(**Update - 2020**: I built this before Gatsby.js was widely known - Gatsby.js only gained popularity around late 2018 and has now become the standard for static react projects served from Github pages. This repo is my shot at hosting static react on GH Pages from 2017 before any frameworks like Gatsby.js were really used for projects.)

### How to run the project

To get started, just
```
git clone git@github.com:Saibotx/portfolio.git
```

then run
```
yarn install
yarn start

```

### How to deploy

```
yarn build
git commit ... git push etc.
```

Then you must go into githubv project settings and change the custom dns!
